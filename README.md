# Streamlit Launchpad

Web launchpad to browse a folder containing multiple Streamlit applications (py files), with a central launchpad listing available apps so you can run them (if not already running) and view each in its own tab.

This is a very basic alpha version.

## Running

Must currently be run from the project folder, and only serves *.py from the examples subfolder.

```
git clone https://github.com/ideonate/streamlit-launchpad.git
cd streamlit-launchpad

python main.py
```
